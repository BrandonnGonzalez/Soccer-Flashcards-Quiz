## üìñ About The Project

The **Soccer Flashcards Quiz** is an engaging, interactive web application designed to help football fans test and improve their knowledge of Premier League players and statistics. Built with modern web technologies, this quiz app features a sleek UI with smooth animations, instant feedback, and an intuitive user experience.

Users can test their knowledge by answering questions about top scorers, fastest players, best defenders, and more. The app provides immediate visual feedback with color-coded responses (green for correct, red for incorrect) and allows users to flip cards to reveal answers.

### üéØ Project Goals

- Create an engaging learning tool for football enthusiasts
- Implement React state management fundamentals
- Build a responsive, mobile-friendly interface

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **[React 18](https://react.dev/)** - Modern UI library with hooks for state management
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** - Next-generation frontend build tool for lightning-fast development
- **CSS3** - Custom styling with Flexbox layouts and CSS transitions

### Development Tools
- **ESLint** - Code quality and consistency
- **npm** - Package management

### Key React Concepts Used
- `useState` hooks for state management
- Component props for data flow
- Conditional rendering
- Event handlers
- Controlled components (form inputs)

## üèóÔ∏è How It Was Built

### Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.jsx           # Main application logic and state management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.css           # Global styles and animations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Card.jsx      # Reusable flashcard component
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.jsx          # React app entry point
```

### State Management

The app uses React's `useState` hook to manage five key pieces of state:

1. **`quizStarted`** - Boolean to control quiz visibility
2. **`currentCardIndex`** - Tracks which question is displayed (0-4)
3. **`isFlipped`** - Controls card flip animation
4. **`userGuess`** - Stores the user's typed answer
5. **`hasGuessed`** - Boolean to track if user has submitted
6. **`isCorrect`** - Boolean to determine visual feedback color

### Key Implementation Details

**Answer Checking Logic:**
```javascript
const checkAnswer = (guess, correctAnswer) => {
  const cleanGuess = guess.toLowerCase().trim();
  const cleanAnswer = correctAnswer.toLowerCase().trim();
  return cleanGuess === cleanAnswer;
};
```

**Dynamic Styling:**
- Conditional CSS classes for correct/incorrect states
- Disabled input after submission to prevent answer changes
- Smooth transitions using CSS `transition` property

**Navigation System:**
- Previous button disabled on first card
- Next button disabled on last card
- All state resets when navigating to preserve quiz integrity
